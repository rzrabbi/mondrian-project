# CSS Grid Practice: Mondrian-Inspired Layout

This project served as a hands-on exercise focused on practicing and mastering CSS Grid layout techniques. The visual inspiration for the layout came from Piet Mondrian's renowned artwork, "Composition No. III, with Red, Blue, Yellow and Black."

## Inspiration (for visual reference)

[Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian) (1872-1944) was a revolutionary Dutch painter and art theoretician, a pioneer of abstract art and a key figure in the De Stijl movement. His work, characterized by bold black lines and primary color blocks, embodies a sense of balance, harmony, and dynamic tension. "Composition No. III, with Red, Blue, Yellow and Black" is a prime example of his distinctive style.

**Note:** While the visual outcome was inspired by Mondrian, the primary objective of this project was to gain practical experience with CSS Grid and its capabilities.

## Objective

The main goal was to **practice and understand CSS Grid layout**. CSS Grid was used to structure elements in a way that mirrored the geometric arrangement of Mondrian's composition. This exercise helped in learning how to:

* Define grid containers and grid items.
* Create grid tracks (rows and columns).
* Position and size grid items using line numbers or named grid areas.
* Explore responsive design with CSS Grid.

## Project Outcome

The project demonstrates a web layout constructed using CSS Grid, visually drawing inspiration from Mondrian's "Composition No. III."

## What Was Learned

Through this project, practical experience was gained in:

* Implementing fundamental CSS Grid concepts.
* Translating a visual design into a grid structure.
* Manipulating grid properties to achieve a specific layout.
* Understanding the flexibility and power of CSS Grid for complex designs.
